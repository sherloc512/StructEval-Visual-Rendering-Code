# The matplotlib library has a module `Sankey` that allows to make basic Sankey Diagrams. This is an example taken from the corresponding [documentation](https://matplotlib.org/api/sankey_api.html) where you will find more examples of this type.  
# 
# These are the parameters used in the example:
# * `flows` : Array of flow values. By convention, inputs are positive and outputs are negative.
# * `labels` : List of labels for the flows (or a single label to be used for all flows).
# * `orientations` : List of orientations of the flows (or a single orientation to be used for all flows). Valid values are 0 (inputs from the left, outputs to the right), 1 (from and to the top) or -1 (from and to the bottom).
