# [Network charts](https://python-graph-gallery.com/network-chart/) can be split into 2 main categories: **directed** and **undirected** networks.  
# 
# If it is **directed**, there is a notion of **flow** between 2 nodes, thus leaving a place to go somewhere else. Like money goes from company A to company B. That’s why you can see (kind of) arrows on the left chart, it gives the direction. The flow goes from B to A for example.  
# 
# If it is **undirected**, there is **just a link** between 2 nodes, like mister A and mister B are friend.  
# 
# When you build your graph, you have to use the function that suits your need: `Graph()` is used for undirected (default), `DiGraph()` is used for directed graph.
