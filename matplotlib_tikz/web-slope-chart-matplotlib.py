# ## About slope charts
# 
# A __slope chart__, also known as a slope graph or a difference chart, is a graphical representation used to display **changes in values** between two or more **data points or categories**. 
# 
# It is particularly useful for comparing the change in values over time, between groups, or across different scenarios. 
# 
# The chart consists of a **series of lines connecting data points**, with each line representing the change in value from one point to another.
# 
# In this article, we will explain how to create the following slope chart, taken from [machinelearningplus.com](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/plots/top-50-matplotlib-visualizations-the-master-plots-python/).

# ## Libraries
# 
# First, you need to install the following librairies:
# - [matplotlib](https://python-graph-gallery.com/matplotlib/) is used for creating the slope chart and for customization
# - [seaborn](https://python-graph-gallery.com/seaborn/) is used for creating the parallel plot
# - `pandas` is used for loading the dataset

# Cell 3
# Libraries
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd

# Markdown Cell 4
# ## Dataset
# 
# The data used is a **famous dataset** where each line represents a country, by year, with various measurements, from [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org). You can find out more about the dataset on this [Kaggle post](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/albertovidalrod/gapminder-dataset).
# 
# To retrieve the data, we download them directly from this [github repository](https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder/tree/main).

# ## Reproducing the slope chart
# 
# The very first thing we do is to create a function `add_label()` that will **add the label** of the gdp per capita at a given year, for a given country. In this function, we define the `x_position` according to the year, by **shifting to the left** on 1952 and to the **right otherwise**.
# 
# Next, we calculate the **average gdp/capita** of each continent for each date using the pandas `groupby()` method. 
# 
# Text and lines are added to the graph using the `text()` and `axvline()` functions.

# Cell 7
def add_label(continent_name, year):
    
    # Calculate value (and round it)
    y_position = round(df[year][continent_name])
    
    # Determine x_position depending on the year  
    if year==1952:
        x_position = year - 1.2
    else:
        x_position = year + 0.12
    
    # Adding the text
    plt.text(x_position, # x-axis position
             y_position, #y-axis position
             f'{continent_name}, {y_position}', # Text
             fontsize=8, # Text size
             color='black', # Text color
            ) 

# Cell 8
# Filter data for the years 1952 and 1957
years = [1952, 1957]
df = df[df['year'].isin(years)]

# Calculate average gdp, per continent, per year
df = df.groupby(['continent', 'year'])['gdpPercap'].mean().unstack()

# (facultative) We artificially change a value to make at least one continent decreasing between the two dates
df.loc['Oceania',1957] = 8503

# Set figsize
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 8))

# Vertical lines for the years
plt.axvline(x=years[0], color='black', linestyle='--', linewidth=1) # 1952
plt.axvline(x=years[1], color='black', linestyle='--', linewidth=1) # 1957

# Add the BEFORE and AFTER
plt.text(1951, 11000, 'BEFORE', fontsize=12, color='black', fontweight='bold')
plt.text(1957.1, 11000, 'AFTER', fontsize=12, color='black', fontweight='bold')

# Plot the line for each continent
for continent in df.index:
    
    # Color depending on the evolution
    value_before = df[df.index==continent][years[0]][0] #gdp/cap of the continent in 1952
    value_after = df[df.index==continent][years[1]][0] #gdp/cap of the continent in 1957
    
    # Red if the value has decreased, green otherwise
    if value_before > value_after:
        color='red'
    else:
        color='green'
    
    # Add the line to the plot
    plt.plot(years, df.loc[continent], marker='o', label=continent, color=color)

# Add label of each continent at each year
for continent_name in df.index:
    for year in df.columns:
        add_label(continent_name, year)

# Add a title ('\n' allow us to jump lines)
plt.title(f'Slope Chart: \nComparing GDP Per Capita between {years[0]} vs {years[1]}  \n\n\n') 

plt.yticks([]) # Remove y-axis
plt.box(False) # Remove the bounding box around plot
plt.show() # Display the chart
